Though there are only 24 countries, your query should return 25 rows because the United Kingdom has 2 customers that share the maximum.

sol:
WITH t1 AS 
(
	SELECT c.CustomerId, c.FirstName, c.LastName,  c.Country, SUM(i.Total) TotalSpent
	FROM 
		Customer c
		JOIN Invoice i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
	GROUP BY c.CustomerId
)

SELECT t1.*
FROM t1
JOIN(
	SELECT Country, MAX(TotalSpent) AS MaxTotalSpent, FirstName, LastName, CustomerId
	FROM t1
	GROUP BY Country
)t2
ON t1.Country = t2.Country
WHERE t1.TotalSpent = t2.MaxTotalSpent
ORDER BY Country;
